Bar chart

This is a simple bar chart visualization made using unity3d.

This example introduces the Unity 'prefab', which is a pre-designed model that can be created multiple times during run time. As shown in the following figure, we create a 'bar' prefab by simply dragging a 'cube' object into the asset folder. All the bars in the bar chart are created by initializing this prefab.

Two functions are provided in this example.

1. Bar chart

2. Random data generation

There are multiple ways to generate the basic bar chart. This example uses a prefab as the bar, which can be easily switched to different shapes instead of the regular bar. The following figure uses a different prefab with blue cube and cylinder to replace the regular bars. Note that the position of the prefab may affect the placement of shape in space. We have two options for locating the 'y' position.
