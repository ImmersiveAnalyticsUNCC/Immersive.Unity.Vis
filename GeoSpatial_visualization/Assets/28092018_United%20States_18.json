This band has no problem throwing down the Rock. The live show sounds huge and is definitely a &quot;Party&quot;. While the Jam Band Sound is slightly present in this band, they will play some country &quot;Zeppelin&quot; with that Bluegrass twist, then let the blues ride until last call. If you like vintage gear these fuckers have shit you never seen: it looks like a garage sale on stage. The amp selection is sick and they play the shit out of them.

In the Heights centers on a variety of characters living in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, on the northern tip of Manhattan. At the center of the show is Usnavi, a bodega owner who looks after the aging Cuban lady next door, pines for the gorgeous girl working in the neighboring beauty salon and dreams of winning the lottery and escaping to the shores of his native Dominican Republic. Meanwhile, Nina, a childhood friend of Usnavis, has returned to the neighborhood from her first year at college with surprising news for her parents, who have spent their life savings on building a better life for their daughter. Ultimately, Usnavi and the residents of the close-knit neighborhood get a dose of what it means to be home. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS What is In the Heights Like? This high-energy show features lovable characters, a contemporary Latin-flavored score and Tony-winning hip-hop dance moves. But its also very sweet and sentimental, wearing its heart on its sleeve. You may even get a little misty-eyed by the end. Is In the Heights Good for Kids? The street-savvy younger characters in In the Heights occasionally swear, but its not any worse than your average PG movie. In this candy-coated take on El Barrio theres really nothing to offend the kids, who will undoubtedly appreciate the cool factor of a central character who emotes in rap.<br> <br> \n","modified":"2018-09-03 15:17:09","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"In the Heights ~ Music & Lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Book by Quiara Alegriia Hudes","venue_address":"311 Euclid Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":"on various days","calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-05-17 02:25:03","venue_id":"V0-001-000173142-5","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2018-09-28 22:30:00","venue_name":"La Habra Depot Theatre","venue_url":"http://orangecounty.eventful.com/venues/la-habra-depot-theatre-/V0-001-000173142-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"FL","postal_code":"33040","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"24.5552932","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/keywest/events/john-lamere-/E0-001-117683854-6@2018092818?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-117683854-6@2018092818","privacy":"1","city_name":"Key West","link_count":null,"longitude":"-81.8022824","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Florida","start_time":"2018-09-28 18:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":null,"modified":"2018-09-03 03:19:03","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"John LaMere","venue_address":"525 Duval Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":"on various days","calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"//d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/040/830/043-5.jpeg_/john-lamere-43.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"//d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/medium/I0-001/040/830/043-5.jpeg_/john-lamere-43.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"//d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/040/830/043-5.jpeg_/john-lamere-43.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"//d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/thumb/I0-001/040/830/043-5.jpeg_/john-lamere-43.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2018-09-03 03:15:19","venue_id":"V0-001-000658517-7","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Willie T's","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/keywest/venues/willie-ts-/V0-001-000658517-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"DC","postal_code":"20005","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"38.9035658","groups":null,"url":"http://washingtondc.eventful.com/events/wine-and-slow-jams-dc-unc-/E0-001-117620106-1@2018092822?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-117620106-1@2018092822","privacy":"1","city_name":"Washington","link_count":null,"longitude":"-77.0341492","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"District of Columbia","start_time":"2018-09-28 22:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Wine and Slow Jams DC is a vibe like no other!

It&#39;s the timeless dilemma many of us have encountered at some point or another. What to do, what to do? Head to Drai&#39;s After Hours in The Cromwell. Look for the gold elevator marked with the curvaceous body of a woman in ruby red dress. The club is located underground where it originally opened in the Barbary Coast. Plain and simple, if you&#39;re looking for after-hours fun on the Strip, this is the place to go. Cashing in on everything saucy about after-hours, Drai’s digs deep to give you a club experience like no other. Just the right amount of dark, hot like that first firm touch on a dance floor, cool like the eyes you use to flirt – Drai’s After Hours is for the clubber who knows what they want and appreciates the finer things in nightlife. The leather is smooth. The dance floor is hopping. And the lights meld with the music to keep you bumping all night long. Just be warned: By the time you come out of the dark club, there’s a good chance you’ll be staring at the sun rising over the Strip. Don’t be alarmed. It just means you have to wait until nightfall to return to Drai’s After Hours.
